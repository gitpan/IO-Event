NAME
    IO::Event - Tied Filehandles for Nonblocking IO with Object Callbacks

DESCRIPTION
    IO::Event provides a object-based callback system for handling
    nonblocking IO. The design goal is to provide a system that just does
    the right thing w/o the user needing to think about it much.

    All APIs are kept as simple as possible yet at the same time, all
    functionality is accesible if needed. Simple things are easy. Hard
    things are possible.

CONSTRUCTORS
    IO::Event->new($filehandle, $handler)
        The basic "new" constructor takes a filehandle and returns a
        psuedo-filehandle. Treat the IO::Event object as a filehandle. Do
        not use the original filehandle without good reason (let us know if
        you find a good reason so we can fix the problem).

        The handler is the class or object where you provide callback
        functions to handle IO events. It defaults to the package of the
        calling context.

    IO::Event::Socket::INET->new( [ARGS] )
        This constructor uses IO::Socket::INET->new() to create a socket
        using the ARGS provided. It returns an IO::Event object.

        The handler defaults as above or can be set with an additional
        pseudo-parameter for IO::Socket::UNIX->new(): "Handler". A
        description for the socket can be provided with an additional
        psuedo-parameter: "Description".

    IO::Event::Socket::UNIX->new( [ARGS] )
        This constructor uses IO::Socket::UNIX->new() to create a socket
        using the ARGS provided. It returns an IO::Event object.

        The handler defaults as above or can be set with an additional
        pseudo-parameter for IO::Socket::UNIX->new(): "Handler". A
        description for the socket can be provided with an additional
        psuedo-parameter: "Description".

MANDATORY HANDLERS
    These handler methods must be available in the handler object/class if
    thit situation in which they would be called arises.

    ie_input($handler, $ieo, $input_buffer_reference)
        Invoked when there is fresh data in the input buffer. The input can
        be retreived via directly reading it from $$input_buffer_reference
        or via "read()" from the $ieo filehandle, or by using a variety of
        standard methods for getting data:

                $ieo->get()             like Data::LineBuffer
                $ieo->read()            like IO::Handle
                $ieo->getline()         like IO::Handle
                $ieo->getlines()        like IO::Handle
                <$ieo>                  like IO::Handle

    ie_connection($handler, $ieo)
        Invoked when a listen()ing socket is ready to accept(). It should
        call accept:

                sub ie_connection
                {
                        my ($ieo) = @_;
                        my $newfh = $ieo->accept()
                }

    ie_read_ready($handler, $underlying_file_handle)
        If autoreading is turned off then this will be invoked.

OPTIONAL HANDLERS
    These handler methods will be called if they are defined but it is not
    required that they be defined.

    ie_eof($handler, $ieo, $input_buffer_reference)
        This is invoked when the read-side of the filehandle has been closed
        by its source.

    ie_output
        This is invoked when data has just been written to the underlying
        filehandle.

    ie_outputdone
        This is invoked when all pending data has just been written to the
        underlying filehandle.

    ie_connected
        This is invoked when a "connect()" completes.

    ie_connect_timeout
        This is invoked when a "connect()" attempt times out.

    ie_died($handler, $ieo, $method, $@)
        If another handler calls "die" then ie_died will be called with the
        IO::Event object, the name of the method just invoked, and the die
        string.

    ie_timer
        This is invoked for timer events. These will only arise if set using
        thing underlying Event object.

    ie_exception
        Invoked when an exceptional condition arises on the underlying
        filehandle

METHODS
    In addition to methods described in detail below, the following methods
    behave like their "IO" (mostly "IO::Socket") counterparts (except for
    being mostly non-blocking...):

            connect
            listen
            open
            close
            read
            syswrite
            print
            eof

    Through AUTOLOAD (see the SUBSTITUTED METHODS section) methods are
    passed to underlying "Event" objects:

            loop
            unloop
            and many more...

    Through AUTOLOAD (see the SUBSTITUTED METHODS section) methods are
    passed to underlying "IO" objects:

            fileno
            stat
            truncate
            error
            opened
            untaint
            and many more...

    IO::Event defines its own methods too:

    ->accept($handler)
        accept() is nearly identical to the normal IO::Socket::accpt()
        method except that instead of optionally passing a class specifier
        for the new socket, you optionally pass a handler object/class. The
        returned filehandle is an IO::Event object.

    ->get()
        get() is like getline() except that it pre-chomp()s the results and
        assumes the input_record_separator is "\n". This is like get() from
        Data::LineBuffer.

    ->unget()
        Push chomp()ed lines back into the input buffer. This is like
        unget() from Data::LineBuffer.

    ->ungetline()
        Push un-chomp()ed lines back into the input buffer.

    ->handler($new_handler)
        Sets the handler object/class if $new_handler is provided. Returns
        the old handler.

    ->filehandle()
        Returns the underlying "IO::Handle".

    ->event()
        Returns the underling "Event".

    ->listener($listening)
        Used to note that a filehandle is being used to listen for
        connections (instead of receiving data). A passed parameter of 0
        does the opposite. Returns the old value. This is mostly used
        internally to IO::Event.

    ->autoread($autoread)
        Get/set automatic reading if data when data can be read. Without
        autoread turned on, the input buffer ins't filled and none of the
        read methods will work. The point of this is for working with
        non-data filehandles. This is an experts-only method that kinda
        defeats the purpose of this module. This would be necessary using
        recv() to get data.

    ->drain()
        Used to start looking for write-ready events on the underlying
        filehandle.

    ->input_record_separator($new_sep)
        IO::Handle doesn't allow input_record_separator's on a per
        filehandle basis. IO::Event does. If you don't ever set a
        filehandle's input record separator, then it contineously defaults
        to the current value of $/. If you set it, then it will use your
        value and never look at $/ again.

SUBSTITUED METHODS
    Any method invications that fail because the method isn't defined in
    IO::Event will by tried twice more: once using trying for a method on
    the inner (hidden) filehandle and once more trying the for a method on
    the Event object that's used to create the select loop for this module.

EXAMPLE SERVER
            # This is a tcp line echo server

            my $listener = IO::Event::Socket::INET->new(
                    Listen => 10,
                    Proto => 'tcp',
                    LocalPort => 2821,
            );

            Event::loop();

            sub ie_connection
            {
                    my ($pkg, $lstnr) = @_;
                    my $client = $lstnr->accept();
                    printf "accepted connection from %s:%s\n",
                            $client->peerhost, $client->peerport;
            }

            sub ie_input
            {
                    my ($pkg, $client, $ibufref) = @_;
                    print $client <$client>;
            }

SEE ALSO
    The following perl modules do something that is kinda similar to what is
    being done here:

            IO::Multiplex
            IO::NonBlocking
            IO::Select
            Event
            POE
            POE::Component::Server::TCP
            Net::Socket::NonBlock
            Net::Server::Multiplex
            NetServer::Generic

    The API borrows most heavily from IO::Multiplex. IO::Event uses Event.pm
    and thus can be used in programs that are already using Event or POE.

BUGS
    Nothing sane is done with excptional conditions. What causes them
    anyway?
